## Introduction

### Concept

*"Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g. networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction".*

### Terms

- [nested virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtualization#Nested_virtualization)
- [overcommitting](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/)

### Features

- **Speed and Agility**
  The required resources are just one click away, which saves time and provides agility. We can also easily scale up or down, depending on our need.
- **Cost** 
  It reduces the up-front cost to set up the infrastructure, and allows us to focus on applications and business. Cloud providers have features to estimate the cost, which helps us plan better.
- **Easy Access to Resources** 
  As users, we can access our infrastructure from any place and device, as long as we can connect to the provider.
- **Maintenance** 
  All the maintenance work for the resources is done by the provider. As end users, we do not have to worry about this aspect.
- **Multi-tenancy** 
  Multiple users can use the same pool of resources.
- **Reliability** 
  Resources can be hosted in different data center locations, to provide increased reliability.

### Model

- **Private Cloud**
  It is designated and operated solely for one organization. It can be hosted internally or externally and managed by internal teams or a third party. We can build a private cloud using a software stack like [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/).
- **Public Cloud**
  It is open to the public and anybody can use it after swiping the credit card. Amazon Web Services and Google Compute Engine are examples of public clouds.
- **Hybrid Cloud**
  Public and private clouds are bound together to offer the hybrid cloud. Among other things, a hybrid cloud can be used to:
  1. Store sensitive information on a private cloud, while offering public services based on that information from a public cloud.
  2. Meet the temporary resources needed from the public cloud. These temporary resources cannot be met from a private cloud.
